plusfeedforone - turn a single "google plus" public-posts feed into an atom feed

	When Russell Beattie had to shut down his plusfeed.appspot.com because of sudden pricing changes,
	I was depending on that service. Thankfully, he released it with an MIT license (Thanks, Russel!)

	So, from <https://github.com/russellbeattie/plusfeed>, I grabbed the code, and taught myself enough
	python to make it work for one feed.

	You will need:
		1) A google plus feed's identifier (check your profile page).
		2) A web server that runs python scripts as CGI or some variant thereof (preferably 24x7).
			a) As a minimum, python will need pycurl installed.
		3) A way to edit the plusfeedforone.py script.
		4) A way to upload the edited script to the proper place on the webserver mentioned above.

	To make it work:
		1) Edit the script, putting the google plus profile identifier in the proper place.
		2) Upload the edited script to the proper place on your webserver so that it runs as CGI.
		3) Test, share, and enjoy.

	Comments:
		1) I am not a programmer. I just taught myself enough python in a week to make this work for me.
		2) There are probably extra things left over from Russell's code that are no longer needed. Meh.
		3) There are probably bugs. It seems to be working for me, however...
		4) If google changes the feed, this will probably break. I may not have time to fix this script then...
		5) I duplicated Russell's choice of MIT license. Feel free to fork away!

	What I use this for:
		I run a self-hosted wordpress blog, with the twitter tools plugin installed and running. I installed WPeMatico,
		which will grab my public google plus posts when pointed to this script, so that anything I post publicly on
		Google Plus will be posted on my blog, then also to twitter (and to facebook, but facebook does a pull).
